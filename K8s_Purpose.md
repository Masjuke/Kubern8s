### Consideration


* Do you just want to try out Kubernetes on your computer, or do you want to build a high-availability, multi-node cluster? Choose distros best suited for your needs.

* If you are designing for high-availability, learn about configuring clusters in multiple zones.

* Will you be using a hosted Kubernetes cluster, such as Google Kubernetes Engine, or hosting your own cluster?

* Will your cluster be on-premises, or in the cloud (IaaS)? Kubernetes does not directly support hybrid clusters. Instead, you can set up multiple clusters.

* If you are configuring Kubernetes on-premises, consider which networking model fits best. One option for custom networking is OpenVSwitch GRE/VxLAN networking, which uses OpenVSwitch to set up networking between pods across Kubernetes nodes.

* Will you be running Kubernetes on “bare metal” hardware or on virtual machines (VMs)?

* Do you just want to run a cluster, or do you expect to do active development of Kubernetes project code? If the latter, choose a actively-developed distro. Some distros only use binary releases, but offer a greater variety of choices.

* Familiarize yourself with the components needed to run a cluster.

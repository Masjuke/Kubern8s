### Testing Horizontal Pod Scaler

Will create another POD with one container to do test, this time I'm not creating through deployment, Replication or daemonsets. but directly creating a single pod with one container

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demo
  namespace: my-kube
spec:
  volumes:
  - name: shared-data
    emptyDir: {}
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-data
      mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html

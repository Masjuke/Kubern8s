### Run kubernetes Dashboard 

* User access

Probably some of your users need to access to kubernetes like developer team, devops team Etc, and each of them need separate privileges and accessible which namespace, pods and deployment they allow to manage then creating different access token or yaml file is needed in this case.

If admin is the only one who can access and have all privileges kubernetes configuration and manage all the service and still want to add another users to have read access that will just fine also

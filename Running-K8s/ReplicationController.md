### Replication Controller

Summary 

`A ReplicationController ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. In other words, a ReplicationController makes sure that a pod or a homogeneous set of pods is always up and available.`

`If there are too many pods, the ReplicationController terminates the extra pods. If there are too few, the ReplicationController starts more pods. Unlike manually created pods, the pods maintained by a ReplicationController are automatically replaced if they fail, are deleted, or are terminated. For example, your pods are re-created on a node after disruptive maintenance such as a kernel upgrade. For this reason, you should use a ReplicationController even if your application requires only a single pod. A ReplicationController is similar to a process supervisor, but instead of supervising individual processes on a single node, the ReplicationController supervises multiple pods across multiple nodes.`

`ReplicationController is often abbreviated to “rc” or “rcs” in discussion, and as a shortcut in kubectl commands.
A simple case is to create one ReplicationController object to reliably run one instance of a Pod indefinitely. A more complex use case is to run several identical replicas of a replicated service, such as web servers.`


Sample of replication controller runs of 4 copies nginx webserver

`$ sudo touch Replication-Controller.yaml && sudo nano Replication-Controller.yaml`

    apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
    kind: ReplicationController
    metadata:
      name: nginx-web
    spec:
      replicas: 4
      selector:
        app: nginx
      template:
        metadata:
          name: nginx-2
          labels:
            app: nginx-2
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: my-nginx
            image: nginx:latest
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
            
  
  `$ kubectl apply -f ./Replication-Controller.yaml -n my-kube` #Create nginx webserver replication controller
  
  Now check status our RC using below command
  
  `$ kubectl describe rc/nginx-web -n my-kube` #Check status of RC nginx-web
  
```shell
